# Liquor Sales Data Analysis

This Python script performs data analysis and visualization on a liquor sales dataset. It includes two main tasks: analyzing liquor sales by zip code and analyzing sales by store. The script uses `pandas` for data manipulation and `matplotlib` for plotting graphs.

## Features

- **Data Loading**: Reads liquor sales data from a CSV file.
- **Data Preparation**: Filters data by date range, processes it to extract relevant columns, and groups data by zip code and store.
- **Visualization**: Generates a scatter plot for liquor sales by zip code and a bar chart for the top stores based on sales percentage.

## Requirements

- `pandas`: For data manipulation.
- `matplotlib`: For plotting graphs.
